# word-composer-game
A final project for a Java course I took in April 2024

A game where the player must form as many words as possible from a given word, using only the letters from the original word. Points are awarded for each guessed word, with longer words earning more points. The game ends either when the player has guessed all the words or when the timer runs out (the timer duration can be adjusted freely). At the end of the game, statistics for each original word are displayed, showing which words were guessed, which were not, and how many times these words were guessed in this combination before.

The game should work in any language, but currently it has a German dictionary inside, so it's a German noun composer :)
